## Overview
The Movie Recommender System is a user-friendly application designed to help movie enthusiasts discover new films tailored to their tastes. The system analyzes metadata such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords to provide personalized movie recommendations.

The app uses a content-based filtering approach, ensuring high-quality suggestions based on the user's selected movie. The train.py script processes the movie metadata and generates the necessary files (movie_list.pkl and similarity.pkl), which are then used by the app for recommendations. Users must run the training script first to prepare the data before using the application.

The accompanying Streamlit web interface offers an intuitive experience, allowing users to explore recommendations, view movie posters, and sort results by rating, release date, or title. With seamless integration of the TMDB API, the app fetches detailed movie information, including posters, ratings, and descriptions, enhancing the user experience.

Whether you're looking for your next favorite movie or exploring new genres, the Movie Recommender System is here to help!


## Key Features
* Suggests movies based on metadata like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
* Sort recommendations by rating, release date, or title.
* Displays movie details, including posters, ratings, genres, and overviews, using the TMDB API.

## Project Structure
* **train.py:** Prepares and trains the model. You do not need to run this as the pre-trained files are already provided.
* **app.py:** The main Streamlit app for user interaction.

#### Data Files (Optional for re-training):
* **tmdb_5000_movies.csv:** Dataset containing movie metadata.
* **tmdb_5000_credits.csv:** Dataset containing movie credits information.

## How It Works
#### Movie Selection:
* Choose a movie from the dropdown menu.
* The app fetches metadata and poster using the TMDB API.
#### Recommendations:
* Displays the top 10 recommendations based on the trained model.
*Includes sorting options: rating, release date, or title.
#### Visual Layout:
* Recommendations are shown in a card-style layout with posters, ratings, genres, and descriptions.\
