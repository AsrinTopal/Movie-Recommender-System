# Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¥
This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences. It consists of two main components:

* **Pre-Trained Model:** The model has already been trained using movie metadata, and the preprocessed files are provided (**movie_list.pkl** and **similarity.pkl**).

* **Web Application:** A Streamlit-based app where users can interactively select movies and get recommendations.

## Overview
The Movie Recommender System is a user-friendly application designed to help movie enthusiasts discover new films tailored to their tastes. Built with a pre-trained machine learning model, the system analyzes metadata such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords to provide personalized movie recommendations.

The app leverages a content-based filtering approach, ensuring high-quality suggestions based on the user's selected movie. By utilizing a pre-computed similarity matrix, the system efficiently delivers results without requiring re-training, making it quick and ready-to-use.

The accompanying Streamlit web interface offers an intuitive experience, allowing users to explore recommendations, view movie posters, and sort results by rating, release date, or title. With a seamless integration of the TMDB API, the app also fetches detailed movie information, enhancing the user experience.

Whether you're looking for your next favorite movie or exploring new genres, the Movie Recommender System has got you covered!


## Key Features
* Suggests movies based on metadata like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
* Sort recommendations by rating, release date, or title.
* Displays movie details, including posters, ratings, genres, and overviews, using the TMDB API.

## Project Structure
* **train.py:** Prepares and trains the model. You do not need to run this as the pre-trained files are already provided.
* **app.py:** The main Streamlit app for user interaction.
#### Pre-Trained Files:
* movie_list.pkl: Preprocessed movie data with metadata tags.
* similarity.pkl: Precomputed cosine similarity matrix.

#### Data Files (Optional for re-training):
* **tmdb_5000_movies.csv:** Dataset containing movie metadata.
* **tmdb_5000_credits.csv:** Dataset containing movie credits information.

## How It Works
#### Movie Selection:
* Choose a movie from the dropdown menu.
* The app fetches metadata and poster using the TMDB API.
#### Recommendations:
* Displays the top 10 recommendations based on the trained model.
*Includes sorting options: rating, release date, or title.
#### Visual Layout:
* Recommendations are shown in a card-style layout with posters, ratings, genres, and descriptions.


## Installation
### Prerequisites
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy: For numerical operations.
* Scikit-learn: For machine learning and vectorization.
* Streamlit: For building and running the web app.
* Requests: For fetching data from the TMDB API.
* Ast: For safely parsing strings into Python objects.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/AsrinTopal/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Streamlit App
```
steamlit run app.py
```
The app will launch in your browser. If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

## Example Output
### Web App
* Selected Movie: Displays the poster and details of the chosen movie.
* Recommended Movies: Suggestions are shown with relevant details like poster, brief description, genres, ratings, and release dates.

## Notes on Training
If you wish to re-train the model, you can use train.py to process the data and generate the movie_list.pkl and similarity.pkl files. However, this is not necessary for running the app as the pre-trained files are already provided.
